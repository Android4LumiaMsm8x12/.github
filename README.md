# Android4LumiaMsm8x12

## This project can bring and run Android on your Lumia with MSM8212/MSM8210 processor (Lumia 530 and Lumia 435 for now)

Here you will find the kernel, device tree, and Android sources for your MSM8212/MSM8210 Lumia.

This project is in the experimental phase because I only tested the Recovery in 2022
